# Kotlineural

## Neural network written in pure kotlin

My attempt to understand how the neural networks work and implement it completely from scratch without using any libraries. 
Do not try using it in production!

This neural network is trained on MNIST database of handwritten numbers (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The maths behind this code can be found here https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpropagation/
